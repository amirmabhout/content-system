## Thank you, next (problem)!
### October 23, 2021
It's an incredible thing to say, but I think we're getting close to our first
anniversary. That's incredible but serves in this post merely as a hook for the
topic I'd like to write about.

This being the increasing throughput of problems I have to face on a daily
basis to drive the project further. 

Just last year, there weren't merely any. I was working on
the thing myself, and also, for the first few months, I
didn't even get paid to host the site.

Now, this has changed drastically and so today RPI contracts a surprising 4
people part-time. We have 49 members on our Discord - and even without me
ranting on Telegram - we have a steady influx of users to our site.
We've got about 15 applications for a more than sparse hiring appeal on HN's
"who's hiring?" thread, and last round, something like 5 million USD voted YES
on us.

All of this is pretty bonkers, particularly when scrolling down and looking at
some of the old posts and the sentiment I had just months ago.

But in that time, and especially now that the dust has settled after last
month's round, I've come to realize (or accept) my faith as a project founder.
Building and shipping, keeping things going is basically just handling a stream
of never-ending problems flying towards you.

It's daunting. Sometimes it's crazy scary. But also, many times, it's
incredibly rewarding and fun.

For me, when I don't code: It has also become more difficult to track and
understand progress. It's almost like being the frog in the pan that gets
boiled. Without the boiling part, maybe (/hopefully).

You solve problems and work to make things happen, and those things do happen,
but somehow you also don't understand what changed. It's almost like being
blind.  Worse, it's like seeing but not being able to interpret. Dream-ish.

I don't dread this experience - so far, I've come to enjoy it. But I've become
more anxious about the project's future and the fact that I seem to carry much
more responsibility than I had imagined.

It's really weird and may also sound tone-deaf for some users not being
involved in our production process. The website's still the same. Everything
looks as it "always has."

But looking internally, things are shifting at incredible speed, and measures
are being taken daily to grow and improve. 

I'm overwhelmed by the passion and precision of our contributors and by how
they pump out knowledge, insights, and code continuously. It's nuts!

So maybe all these words had the following purpose: To thank everyone that has
helped and believed in Rug Pull Index over the last year.

I'm grateful for you to be with us, and I'm in joy seeing that we share ideas
and goals. I'm curious as ever to see where we'll go!

Thank you!
