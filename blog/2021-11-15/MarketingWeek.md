## Marketing Week
### November 15, 2021

It's "Marketing Week", y'all!

What that means? It means that for the whole week, I'll plan to lay down the
coding utensils and work on things completely out of my comfort zone. How come?

It's because I had a minor epiphany on the weekend when reading and commenting
on HN's "Ask HN" page. Someone posted, ["Tips For Making a Popular Open Source
Project in 2021"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29197806) which led me
to write the following
[comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29198039):

An interesting discussion between a fellow HN user and me ensued and it kind of
threw me back to when I read "Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide to
Launching a Startup" by Rob Walling. In a post from July this year, titled ["On
The Value Of Product And
Distribution"](#OnTheValueOfProductAndDistribution) I
had even written about some of those ideas. Given that our recent SEO had high
efficacy, I want to double down on those efforts now.

According to Rob's book, prioritizing the "Top shelf" traffic strategies is key
and I agree with is rationale in the book. He argues that the most sustainable
strategies are to: 

- Maintain a mailing list
- Write a blog; and
- Improve organic search.

I also agree with him that "second shelf" strategies are social media and
pay-to-click advertisement. They can help growth, but they aren't sustainable.
Only finding and retaining a target audience can be.

So this week, I want to commit myself to do something that's VERY
counterintuitive to me: I want to *avoid coding* and instead focus on how I can
improve and scale my communication. A few preliminary goals:

- I want to split up this giant blog page into separate pages to improve SEO
- I want to create a mailing list for RPI
- I want to help improve the overall website copy and e.g. move on from text to
  potentially interactive graphical pages too.
- I want to help communicate the new RPI vision.

I'm excited to try something else this week and I hope you can share my
enthusiasm.  In case you have time and want to help, hop on our Discord and
reach out.

Best,
Tim
