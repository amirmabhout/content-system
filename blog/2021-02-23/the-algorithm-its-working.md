title: The Algorithm; It's Working!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1.) We decided to
close our Oceancap pool on 21/02 due to the market situation. We are pretty

is working hard on preparing an updated Marketplace in the near future. We are
waiting on the sidelines and take a break for now.</p>&mdash; Oceancap -

Since rugpullindex.com listed ADASTA-60 in its TOP 25 index for a while, I was
curious how the ranking algorithm would react to the announcement. Remember,
the algorithm ranks a data set based on its market's performance. It works
"autonomously" and isn't capable of comprehending the statementâ€”instead, it's
rating each data set by its market's performance. Our thesis is that if a data
set's market is strong, its value is high too and vice versa.

Here is ADASTA-60's performance within the context of the announcement:

| Date | Score | Gini | Liquidity (OCEAN) | Price (OCEAN) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2021-02-17T23:01:04.300Z | 0.62 | 0.98 | 38969 | 20.80 |
| 2021-02-18T23:01:03.913Z | 0.60 | 0.98 | 37664 | 19.60 |
| 2021-02-19T23:01:03.956Z | 0.55 | 0.98 | 37549 | 19.47 |
| 2021-02-20T23:01:04.073Z | 0.57 | 0.98 | 37549 | 19.47 |
| 2021-02-21T23:03:56.286Z | 0.45 | 0.97 | 21411 | 11.10 |
| 2021-02-22T23:01:03.474Z | 0.22 | 0.96 | 9148 | 4.74 |

Looking at the market's data, we can see the following:

- The share equality of liquidity providers to ADASTA-60's pool has historically
been somewhat on the centralized side, meaning a few LPs had lots of control.
The factor "Gini," close to 1, shows this clearly.
- Within just roughly a week, ADASTA-60's liquidity dried up, resulting in a 4x
  decrease.
- Its price tanked too; ADASTA-60 fell from 20 OCEAN last Wednesday to 4 OCEAN
  (5x).

#### Conclusion

rugpullindex.com's initial thesis that markets are a proxy for data sets has
found some evidence in this particular case. rugpullindex.com successfully
forecasted an investment risk (Gini-Index close to 1) before it manifested
itself. Its algorithm is now automatically decreasing ADASTA-60's stake as the
market reacts to the announcement.

I find this result excited as it's the first time we can see the
collected data and my work in action. ðŸ¥³

In the future, I want users to gain the same insights I was able to acquire
today. I'm excited to continue working on that.

Best, Tim
