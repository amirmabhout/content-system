#### Ocean Stakers

**Context** 

As these users have gotten to know more about Ocean Protocol they have realised
it could be beneficial for them to stake their Ocean tokens on data sets. They
have discovered RPI as a potential tool to help them with this decision making
process.

**Motivation**

They are trying to maximise their rewards for staking Ocean tokens. 

**Pain Points**

There’s both a high learning barrier to overcome and a lack of accessible,
clear information. There also may be some uncertainty when it comes to the
quality of information and likelihood of generating an ROI on what is a new and
volatile asset.

**Mental Models**

The user has so many options when it comes to allocating their capital within
new crypto projects. If they have gotten this far they probably understand the
value proposition and vision of Ocean Protocol quite well and are wanting to
get into something in the hopes of generating a good ROI. 

**What I want from RPI:**

* What are the staking rewards?
* What are historic staking returns?
* What’s the risk level (rugpull, other)?

**Questions I might have when landing on RPI now:**

* What does this chart mean?
* What do these columns mean?
* Which columns do I care about?
* How can I learn more about this?

#### Data Token Investors

**Context**

As these users have gotten to know more about Ocean protocol they have realised
it could be beneficial for them to invest in data tokens. They have discovered
RPI as a potential tool to help them with this decision making process.

**Motivation**

They are trying to find valuable data tokens to invest in assuming that both
Ocean and the data set will do well over the long term. 

**Pain Points**

It’s really time consuming to go through each dataset and try to find the ones
that are most valuable. It’s also unclear exactly how to ‘value’ a data set as
there are many factors to consider i.e. data provider’s reputation, number of
sales, staking rewards, is the data set being maintained, does the dataset have
buyers, who is the dataset targeting, is the data actually valuable etc etc...

**Mental Models** 

The user has so many options when it comes to allocating their capital within
new crypto projects. If they have gotten this far they probably understand the
value proposition and vision of Ocean Protocol quite well and are wanting to
get into something in the hopes of generating a good ROI.

**What I want from RPI:**

* Where are the good datasets?
* How many purchases have there been for this dataset?
* What are data tokens? (for converting ‘potential’ data token investors)

**Questions I might have when landing on RPI now:**

* What does this chart mean?
* What do these columns mean?
* Which columns do I care about?
* How can I learn more about this?

#### RPI Community Members

**Context**

These users are active or thinking about becoming active in the Web3 ecosystem. 

**Motivation**

These users are looking for cool/interesting projects to work on &/or become an
early adopter of something which could grow into being much bigger in the
future presenting a potentially high economic incentive. 

**Pain Points**

Hard to find quality projects with good teams to collaborate with/active
engaged communities that I can become more engaged with.

**Mental Models**

If this is a cool project or something which I believe could grow into
something much bigger, then I would like to keep engaged with the community,
potentially help out or get more involved as the project grows. 

#### API Users

**Context**

These users are developers &/or business people looking to integrate the RPI
API into their work/product. 

**Motivation**

They want to build a product using our data. RPI has more than 9 months worth
of pricing data. By querying this data directly from our API, they can save
time and money building a custom solution.

**Pain Points**

Some users are coming to RPI because they’ve been left behind by Ocean
Protocol. We’re a technically driven product that’s quite approachable by
developers. They know what they get from RPI when compared to the more
advanced-looking tech stack of the Ocean Protocol.

**Mental Models**

API users's way of thinking is highly utilitarian. They want to build something
and so they’re looking for the most cost-effective way of getting it done.
RPI’s simple and approachable API gives them a dopamine hit because they
immediately get it.

#### Other Data Token Platforms

**Context**

Other platforms have forked/created their own data marketplaces and data
platforms (separate to the Ocean ecosystem). They too are looking to acquire
users/investors/contributors to their platforms. They see RPI as targeting the
same audience they are interested in.

**Motivation**

They understand the value of data marketplaces naturally and by getting listed
by the Rug Pull Index, they see it as a way to acquire new customers and push
their data consume revenue up.

**Pain Points**

Accessing the right target audience can be time consuming and difficult. First
you need to find where the target users are, next you need to collaborate with
the platform to negotiate terms and execute the plan/integration. The data
investor community is very small. So far, only Ocean has managed to grow a
little community of early adopters. So anyone that’s in this market too has to
either associate themselves with the OCEAN community or seek out to create one
by themselves.

**Mental Models**

Other Data Platforms are motivated to join RPI if the value proposition is
right. They are interested, have budget and an aligned interest to be on RPI
and to leverage the network that’s already there and that will hopefully be
there in the future. Still, currently Other Data Platforms are struggling to
partner with RPI as it's not a legally incorporated company and since the value
proposition of their investment is unclear.

#### Ocean DAO Members

**Context**

Ocean DAO members have varying levels of interest/engagement in Ocean Protocol
but a number of influential players have a much larger influence relatively
speaking. 

**Motivation**

Important OceanDAO members are primarily big holders of Ocean tokens. They want
the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem to flourish. They are looking for projects that
have a good ROI and will continue to support the ones they believe do. 

**Pain Points**

OceanDAO members are mostly concerned about the OCEANs that they hold. They
want as many well-maintained projects arising from the OceanDAO as possible.
Their interest is less in the survival of individual projects and more in the
correct strategic functioning of the OceanDAO’s funding mechanism. Their
ultimate goal is to make a return on their initial OCEAN investment. OceanDAO
members have limited time to do due diligence given the sheer amount of
projects. Hence it’s often hard for them to keep on top of projects and see
which are adding value.

**Mental Models**

OceanDAO members want to see RPI succeed given that it continues to make
technical process and helps guide the Ocean Protocol mission. With the rising
number of participants in the OceanDAO, members are starting to get less chance
to do proper due diligence. They may also simply vote to burn Oceans if they
see no proper engagement.

#### Data Providers

**Context**

Data Providers are looking for ways to make their datasets more appealing to
potential stakers, investors, buyers. Data Providers want to make money. If RPI
is seen as a key source of ‘quality datasets’ within the Ocean ecosystem then
they want to know how they can be a part of the action and make their datasets
‘better’ or rank higher. 

**Motivation**

To get more Ocean staked on their datasets, increase the discoverability of
their datasets and increase number of sales.

**Pain Points**

Data providers' biggest problem is that they can't make a good value
proposition to data consumers. Data consumers always face the risk of buying a
rug pull in disguise.

No Data Provider has made a return on a tokenized piece of data yet. It is
difficult to understand if a single sale can make a data set worthless. It's
hard to find stakers and buyers for data sets, expecially when purely focus on
technical innovation and e.g. not marketing.

**Mental Models**

RPI allows a data provider to get (relatively speaking) many eyes on their data
token. For the top data providers, being listed as a top project on RPI is of
significance as it directs lots of attention and clicks to their web presence
(Click through rate). Additionally, RPI can serve as an additional benchmark
for how well a data provider's token is doing in the overall market.

#### Data Buyers

**Context**

Data buyers are likely still far and few between but when they do arrive to the
ecosystem they will be looking for a quick and easy way to find/browse the
datasets that they need (or might need). 

**Motivation**

They will have a specific use case in mind and be looking for data to help
address that use case. We speculate that Data Buyers have highly utilitarian
motivations too. If they know they can make more money through buying a data
set, they'll pay its price.

**Pain Points**

The problem with finding data is that it almost directly has to be created for
your specific use case for it to be relevant or valuable. Already when having a
hypothesis, we humans tend to solve it “by proxy”, meaning we answer different
questions and not the original one instead. For data sets, this is the same
problem. A data set’s value is not universally the same for any one as some
buyers are able to extract significantly more value from it than others.

E.g., if you had gotten ahold of the Cambridge Analytical data set before the
2016 US election, would it have provided you the same level of utility as it
did to the Trump campaign team?

Finding the data set they require is an immense and time consuming challenge
for data buyers.

**Mental Models**

If I find a dataset that might be useful: How do I know it's
useful/trustworthy/valuable? How do I know that the Ocean Protocol works as I
expected it? What information can I access to give myself a high level of
confidence that this thing is even worth purchasing and that I'm not getting
scammed.
