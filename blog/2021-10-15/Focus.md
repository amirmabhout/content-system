## Focus
### October 15, 2021

In turbulent times, I sometimes tend to undervalue focus. Some people value
focus much more than I do. I think focus is worthless when there's no
confidence in knowing the right direction. Figuring out what to do next is more
important than focusing, sometimes.

But now, it's time to build (and focus). And here's what we want to spend time
on:

- We want to further annotate Ocean Protocol data sets through
  [@rugpullindex/list-metadata](https://github.com/rugpullindex/list-metadata).
  Our overarching goal here is to create trust through transparency. We think
  [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com) does a fantastic job on that with L2
  infrastructure. For as long as [Ocean's provider
  mechanism](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider) is unsafe, we must
  promote the option to enable recourse through traditional means (e.g. the
  law) to increase [Data Consume
  Volume](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-Roi#whats-a-good-metric-for-bang).
- We want to create a smart contract consumable version of the Rug Pull Index
  API. We don't care for "write" yet. We aspire to do "read" _really_ well. An
  inspiration is [zeriontech/defi-sdk](https://github.com/zeriontech/defi-sdk).
- We want to spend significantly less time on raising funds. Since 2021-10-01,
  I (Tim) spent a total of > 40h on campaigning, fundraising and updating the
  project standing. This ended up being necessary given the OceanDAO process.
  We want to short-circuit that process to spend less time and get the same
  amount of money to build more and do less politics.

That's all. Thanks for reading.

Best,
Tim
