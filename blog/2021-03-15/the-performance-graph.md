title: The Performance Graph

In [OceanDAO Round
3](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/rugpullindex-com-round-3-proposal/434), I
announced building towards a graph that shows the index's historical
performance. But for the last month or so, most of the changelog I published on
the blog was about improving database queries. Indeed, I had to adjust all of
those to show the following graph today:

Here, you can see a first try at displaying the index's performance starting on
February 15, 2021, to March 15, 2021. X-axis showing the dates of measurement,
y-axis the index's price in EUR. Please note that I haven't had time to confirm
its correctness yet. However, it looks roughly correct. So how did I create
this graph?

- I assume an index value `target = 100` (in EUR)
- For each data set's score, I calculate a relative score `relative_score =
  score / SUM(scores)`
- For each data set, I then calculate a share amount `share = relative_score *
  target / price`
- A `share` represents the number of tokens the index holds for a
  given data set. After buying a target of 100â‚¬ in tokens, all I do is note
  down daily all token prices. By summing all token prices per day, I get the
  index value per day. And those values, I plotted in this graph.

I know, for now, that might sound not very easy. But I've plans to improve this
communication. Anyways, that's today's update.

Best,
Tim

PS: Another change I made today:

- Continue improving ranking algorithm's data base queries. It should now
  finally be possible to get a reliable ranking querying the data base by any
  past date. Next up is aggregating all these results and dumping them in a
  chart.
