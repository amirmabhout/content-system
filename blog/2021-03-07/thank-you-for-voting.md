title: Thank You For Voting

---

On Friday, March 5, 2021, OceanDAO's round 3 vote finished. If you browsed the
website last week, you might have noticed the yellow call-for-votes I had put
on the front page. I can't prove that it had much of an effect on the voting
outcome, but I can say that there's an essential difference between the votes
of rounds two and three. Let's look at the data.

In round 2, 63.08k OCEAN tokens or three addresses voted for rugpullindex.
That's 5.28% of all votes. This time around, 233.54k OCEAN tokens or two
addresses voted, making it 7.73% (+2,48% or an increase of 47%, relative to
round 2) of all tickets that voted.

I doubt that we can draw many insights from the above-presented data. Still, in
the spirit of gathering data for self-improvement and record some insights for
posterity, let's look at what deliberate optimizations I made between rounds 2
and 3:

- I approached potential voters directly by adding a little yellow note to the
front page. I also reached out to voters directly.
- I spent more time working on rugpullindex.com in February than any month
before.
- I actively wrote about the project on this blog and circulated my thoughts on
social media.
- I kept my R3 proposal concise and clear.
- As I said, I don't think there's much meaning behind these statements yet.
But I wanted to note them down anyways and maybe come back to this post in the
future.

Lastly, I'd like to thank all of my voters! Your vote allows me to spend
quality time on issues that I think are worth exploring, thinking about, and
fixing. Thank you! That's all for today.

Best,
Tim
