# About

rugpullindex.com is a data set index that measures the data set performance of
all assets listed on the [Ocean Protocol Data
Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com). It's a liquidity and
gini-coefficient weighted index and features popular data sets, such as those
of [DataUnion.app](https://dataunion.app/) (QUICRA-0),
[Evotegra](https://www.evotegra.de) (EXACANE-93), [Swash](https://swashapp.io/)
(GENFUG-26), [Innovation Atelier SA](https://innovationatelier.com/)
(LUMSTA-42), [DataWhale](https://datawhale.online) (TREPEL-36).

## Technical Details

We crawl all of Ocean Protocol's data markets on a daily basis.  All data
markets are then ranked relatively to their market's liqudity and by how equal
the market's stake is distributed among liquidity providers (we use a [gini
coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gini_coefficient&oldid=985147212)).

What you can see the result on the front page: The best data sets are ranked
highest.

## Vision

Our long-term vision is the creation of a decentralized index coin (ERC-20) on
Ethereum that will allow investors to gain diversified exposure to the best
data assets sold on Ethereum. Follow our [blog](/blog) for the latest updates.
